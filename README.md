This is a very simple Pokedex single page client application built with React, Redux, Webpack, and Babel.

It's just meant for learning.

To run locally:
```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

To generate bundle.js (after running `npm install`)
```
node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
```

This will generate the bundled JavaScript and add it to the `dist/` folder. Grab the file and put it in a new `static/` folder.
